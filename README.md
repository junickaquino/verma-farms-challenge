# verma-farms-challenge
A web shop front-end code challenge for Verma Farms.

Open index.html or open a live server in VS Code using an extension to view the website.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS/SCSS, and a little bit of Javascript.
Wasn't able to finish the website entirely, but I had fun nonetheless!

### Live demonstration and code for the website
*The video might get a little bit pixelated at first, but if you scroll through the timeline a bit, it should fix it. This was recorded in Zoom so the quality may not be the best.*
